<h1>Movie-App</h1>

<p>
   I developed a Movie-App using React-Native features. This site works smoothly on both IOS and Android environments. With the API I use, you can view hundreds of movies under 3 different categories. Can access movie details. Can list players. You can access player details. You can search for movies using the Seach button.</p>
